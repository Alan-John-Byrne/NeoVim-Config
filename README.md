> **NOTE:** This is a custom configuration project meant to mimick typical IDEs, using PowerShell7/WezTerm. It's a work
> in progress. <u>_I'm hoping to cover Unix system settings at some point._</u>

**GOAL:** To put multiple complex tools together to form a powerful and extensive development environment.

> **PAIN POINTS**: \_<u>A list of mistakes I've made, and how to avoid them.</u>
>
> - <u>_'LSP won't activate when opening singular code file'</u> (**vim.lsp.config()/nvim-lspconfig/mason-lspconfig**)_:
>   If you open a single code file (e.g.: a _.py_ or _.js_ or _.ts_ file) with Neovim (i.e.: _nvim_ \<codeFileName>), the LSP for
>   that particular language **_WILL NOT_** be able to establish the root directory context for that '_project_' (<u>even though it's not
>   a full project you're worrying about, it's just a single script / code file</u>). You _**MUST**_ open Neovim within the
>   directory containing that file your concerned about (i.e.: **_JUST_** ' _nvim_ ' ), <u>**_it's a requirement for proper LSP use_**</u>.
> - <u>_'File is too large to open'</u> (**mini.files**)_: If the file is currently stored
>   on your OneDrive, please ensure your OneDrive is running and synced so you
>   actually have the file locally on your machine, to open it.
> - <u>_'Snacks terminal not opening in the same directory as the current buffer'</u> (**snacks.nvim**)_: The terminal
>   provided by the snacks.nvim package (<u>_triggered via the keybind 'CTRL + /'_</u>) will open in the same directory
>   where you initially entered neovim. I've added a which-key keybind to allow you
>   set the current directory to the parent directory of the current buffer, use '\<leader> + \\'. Then when you enter
>   the snacks terminal, it'll open in the same directory as the current buffer, without having to first exit and re-enter
>   neovim in that desired directory.

## Use Cases:

- **Work on Projects (eg: _React + Ts /w Vite_)**: (<u>_More frameworks & libraries can be supported_</u>)
  ![Vite + React + TS](.images/vite_reactts_project.jpg)

- **Study Algorithms w/ WezTerm Multiplexing**: (_<u>Image Previewer included</u>_)
  ![Studying Kandane's Algorithm](.images/study_algos.jpg)

  > **NOTE:** Image previewing ONLY WORKS in terminals that support the necessary image protocols, such as WezTerm, Kitty, or other compatible terminal emulators. This will **NOT** work in PowerShell, Command Prompt, or basic terminal emulators that lack support for those protocols.

- **Debug Software w/ Nvim-Dap:**
  ![Debugging Code](.images/debugging.jpg)
- **Use Polyglot Development w/ WezTerm Multiplexing:**

I plan on adding as many useful frameworks as possible.

## Setup:

All can be setup in the following steps:

1. Use a windows package manager of your choice (_i.e.: <u>winget</u> or <u>chocolatey</u>_) to install NeoVim onto your system.
2. Clone or fork this repository to make it your own, into your '_C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local_' directory. (Overwrite the 'nvim' directory if it exists already after following step **1**)
3. Install the following software, and configure the following environment variables <u>_exactly_</u> as is to complete the setup.

> **NOTE**: This setup does require some knowledge of powershell profiles for correctly setting environment variables
> (_used during open powershell sessions_), _**OR**_ _you could just set them within the global environment table
> on windows_ ~<u>_NOT AS CLEAN_</u>.

### Environment variables (_Profile Specific_):

You can have multiple programming languages supported within neovim. However, in order for these languages to work, there are a few pre-requisites
that need to be in place prior to utilisation. Following is a table of environment variables that must be set to the correct values
(_<u>paths to particular pieces of software</u>_) in accordance to the intended plugins specifications. The plugins themselves dictate
what versions of these software components are depended on in order to work correctly. So, in case of any updates to these plugin specs,
please read them again in case of any changes being made to these dependencies.

| Variable                             | Description                                               | Why?                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$env:JAVA_HOME`                     | Path to Java installation directory.                      | Java 21 required as 'JAVA_HOME' for nvim-jdtls to function. This variable points to the JDK itself, providing programs the java tools required to function. |
| `$env:DOTNET_ROOT`                   | .NET SDK root directory.                                  | .NET6.0 SDK / Runtime required for the OmniSharp LSP support within NeoVim. The latest that can be used is version 8.\*.\*                                  |
| `$env:CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` | Specifies default CMake generator.                        | We need to tell the 'Ninja' generator to create instructions for the 'clangd' LSP. It details how C++ projects are structured.                              |
| `$env:CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`              | Specifies build type for CMake (e.g., Debug/Release).     | Change this between 'Debug' or 'Release' depending on whether or not you want to include debug symbols for debugging using nvim-dap in C++ projects.        |
| `$env:CMAKE_BUILD_GENERATOR`         | Specifies the generator to be used for the build process. | Ninja is one build generator that is compatible with neovim.                                                                                                |

> **NOTE:** **'CMAKE_BUILD_GENERATOR'** should only be specified within any 'CMakeLists.txt' files you have within your C++ projects. In case your using other IDEs like Visual Studio too.

### Global environment variables:

Some environment Variables are required to be exposed to the OS at all times. For example, if you're
using the WezTerm Multiplexer (MUX), it will NOT be able to see the variables you've set within your terminal profile. <u>**It can only view those that are set within the global table, via your system settings.**</u>

| Variable               | Description                                             | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to '.wezterm.lua' config file. (Seperate to $PATH) | The 'wezterm.exe' process must be able to access its configuration file before it initializes. Since WezTerm is responsible for launching the shell or terminal program specified in 'config.default_prog' and 'config.launch_menu', the configuration needs to be available globally. Not just within a shell profile like (profile.ps1). If the '$WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE' variable is only set in a shell profile, it won't be recognised when WezTerm starts, as the shell itself hasn't been launched yet. |
| `path\to\pwsh.exe`     | Path to 'pwsh.exe'. (Included in $PATH)                 | Required for WezTerm terminal emulator to properly execute PowerShell 7 commands and scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

> **NOTE:** It's important that these variables are set correctly and in the right way so WezTerm
> can see it's configuration and use any custom preferences you've set within your '.wezterm.lua' config file.

### **Executables to add to "_$PATH_":**

Considering the scope of this '_configuration_' project, there is a lot of programs that need to be
exposed to the OS. Either via a powershell profile, or the global environment variables table (_accessible via your system settings_).
Plugins will then be able to access and utilise these programs within neovim, allowing them to function as intended. Why do I suggest exposing them via
a profile instead of global table? To keep your global environment variables table tidy, as it should only be used for programs that are required system wide.

### **Luarocks modules / rocks (<u>_packages/libraries_</u>) support:**

Luarocks is a native lua package manager. You can download and use modules to make life a little easier both within a Neovim and/or a Wezterm context.

<u>_What do I mean by this?_</u>

I mean that it's possible to install luarock modules within Neovim's configuration directory hierarchy, and also allow Wezterm to '_see_' those modules so it too can use them.
This project is configured in this exact way. The surrounding WezTerm application / process is '_pointed to_' the this install path. _This was purely by choice to keep everything
as tightly bundled together as possible_. So, you can easily navigate to the same directory to make changes to rocks you've installed, and this will affect both NeoVim and WezTerm
(_at least in terms of what luarock modules they 'see' at runtime_).

_**<u>Steps to configure:</u>**_

1. Download the lua package via chocolatey (<u>_this will **ALSO** include luarocks_</u>).
   > _Note_: Chocolotey installs a windows compatible version of lua (v5.1), and luarocks.
   > A 'luarocks' folder will be created within the 'ProgramData' directory in your C: drive.
   > LuaRocks uses this directory as part of it's runtime configuration.
2. Create a file called 'config.lua' file within that 'luarocks' directory.
3. Type the following snippet into that 'config.lua' file:

<p align="center">
<img src=".images/luarocks_config.png" alt="luarocks configuration" width="850" height="260">
</p>

> _Note_: This path should be later added to the runtimepath (rtp) for both your Neovim and Wezterm application instances, so both can look into this directory to be able to '<u>_require_</u>' modules installed via luarocks.

4. Point the luarocks package manager to it's intended configuration file, by setting the $env:LUAROCKS_CONFIG environment variable within your powershell profile.

<p align="center">
<img src=".images/luarocks_env_var.png" alt="luarocks environment variable" width="850" height="40">
</p>

That's it, you should now be able to require modules both within a Neovim or Wezterm application runtime context.

> _Note_: When using the 'luarocks install' command, you **MUST** use the '--tree' parameter to specify the name of the root you wish to access, in order to install the plugin there. 'system' is the default, and is considered '_system-wide_', and is handled by chocolatey.
