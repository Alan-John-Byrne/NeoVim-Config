**GOAL:** Put multiple complex tools together to form a powerful and extensive development environment.

> **NOTE:** This is a custom project/IDE using PowerShell7/WezTerm. A work in progress that's ever changing.
> There's plans to create a compatible setup for Unix environments.

## Use Cases:

- **Studying Algorithms**:
  ![Kandan's Algorithm Code](.images/kandanes_algorithm_code.jpg)
- **Image Previewer**: (Studying Algorithms w/ *MS Paint*ðŸŽ¨)
  ![MS Paint Illustration](.images/image_previewer.jpg)

  > **NOTE:** Image previewing ONLY WORKS in terminals that support the necessary image protocols, such as WezTerm, Kitty, or other compatible terminal emulators. This will **NOT** work in PowerShell, Command Prompt, or basic terminal emulators that lack support for those protocols.

- Debugging Software:

## Setup:

This setup does require some knowledge of powershell profiles for correctly setting environment variables
(_used during open powershell sessions_), or you could just set them within the global table on windows.

### Environment Variables (Profile Specific)

This config is intended to demonstrate that it's possible to have multiple language support within neovim.
In order for these languages to work, there are a few pre-requisites that need to be in place prior to utilisation.

| Variable                        | Description                                               | Why?                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JAVA_HOME`                     | Path to Java installation directory.                      | Java 21 required as 'JAVA_HOME' for nvim-jdtls to function. This variable points to the JDK itself, providing programs the java tools required to function. |
| `DOTNET_ROOT`                   | .NET SDK root directory.                                  | .NET6.0 SDK / Runtime required for the OmniSharp LSP support within NeoVim. The latest that can be used is version 8.\*.\*                                  |
| `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` | Specifies default CMake generator.                        | We need to tell the 'Ninja' generator to create instructions for the 'clangd' LSP. It details how C++ projects are structured.                              |
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`              | Specifies build type for CMake (e.g., Debug/Release).     | Change this between 'Debug' or 'Release' depending on whether or not you want to include debug symbols for debugging using nvim-dap in C++ projects.        |
| `CMAKE_BUILD_GENERATOR`         | Specifies the generator to be used for the build process. | Ninja is one generator that is compatible with neovim.                                                                                                      |

> **NOTE:** **'CMAKE_BUILD_GENERATOR'** should only be specified within any 'CMakeLists.txt' files you have within your C++ projects. In case your using other IDEs like Visual Studio too.

### Global Environment Variables:

Some environment Variables are required to exposed to the OS at all times. For example, if you're
using the WezTerm Multiplexer (MUX), it won't be able to see the variables you've set within your terminal
profiles, <u>**only those that are global and set via your system settings**.</u>

| Variable               | Description                                        | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to '.wezterm.lua' config file. (NOT IN $PATH) | The 'wezterm.exe' process must be able to access its configuration file before it initializes. Since WezTerm is responsible for launching the shell or terminal program specified in 'config.default_prog' and 'config.launch_menu', the configuration needs to be available globally. Not just within a shell profile like '.bashrc' or 'profile.ps1'. If the '$WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE' variable is only set in a shell profile, it won't be recognised when WezTerm starts, as the shell itself hasn't been launched yet. |

> **NOTE:** It's important that these variables are set correctly and in the right way so WezTerm
> can see it's configuration and use any custom preferences you've set within your '.wezterm.lua' file.

### **Required executables to add to the "$PATH" variable:**

Considering the scope and ambitious versatility of this configuration project, there's alot of programs that need to be
exposed to the Windows OS via either a powershell profile, or your global environment variables table accessible via the windows settings.
This allows for these programs to be used by plugins in neovim, allowing them to work as intended.

| Executable                       | Description                                                                                                                 | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
