## Testing Framework Support: (_via neotest_)

| Framework  | Adapter Support |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Playwright | &#x2611;        |
| Jest       | &#x274C;        |

I plan on adding as many useful frameworks as possible.

Passing environment variables to _Node.js_ based neotest-adapters: <br>
When developing a Node.js application within VS code, it's highly likely you would use the 'dotenv'
package to load in custom environment variables from '.env' files, which would contain sensitive data
you wouldn't want to track on github. **_THIS WILL NOT WORK IN NEOVIM, USING NEOTEST._**

Instead, you must dynamically populate the 'env' table / option within the adapters configuration.
Similarly as you would any '.env' file when coding elsewhere. **_See the below examples for the 'neotest-playwright' adapter:_**

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_'env.lua' file_** : <br><br> This is what will replace your typical '.env' file when using any adapter within neovim.                                                                                                                                                              | <img src=".images/neotest_env_variables_file.png" alt="WezTerm Logo" width="25000" height="500">                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **_adapter_** : <br><br> This is the actual test runner that integrates with the '_nvim-neotest_' plugin. This is where you env variables should be either statically placed (_a regular lua table_), or dyamically loaded using a lua function.                                      | <img src=".images/neotest_env_variables_adapter_config.png" alt="WezTerm Logo" width="25000" height="475"> <br><br> > **Note**: The goal is to have these dynamically loaded from your Node.js project root directory. Just like a regular '_.env_' file would be, when using vscode and the 'dotenv' package. |
| **_Node.js project root search lua function_** : <br><br> This is how you should dynamically load your '_env.lua_' table of environment variables into your adapter. Because, at runtime (i.e.: _during a test run_) they can be used by the test runner process via '_process.env_'. | <img src=".images/neotest_env_variables_population_method.png" alt="WezTerm Logo" width="25000" height="250"> <br><br> > **Note**: It's vital to understand that it's not your actual web application / Node.js project's runtime variables (_process.env_), it's the neotest test runners.                    |

**Why is this?**<br>
These adapters are external Node.js processes themselves, and they have their own respective '_process.env_'
runtime environment variables that they have access to.

They populate their own internal 'process.env' via the 'env' option within the adapter
configuration written in lua (_as shown in the last snippet above_). So, when using and adapter
to run tests, you are actually starting up a seperate Node.js process (_the adapter standalone script_)
to do so.

Therefore, changing your own projects 'process.env' file when trying to add environment
variables, will **NOT** work. The adapter won't be able to see them, during it's own runtime (i.e.: _when it's running tests_),
because your project Node.js process, and the adapter script's Node.js process, are running within two seperate runtime contexts.
The adapter almost being a child Node.js process, being run below your own full Node.js application process.

### Setup:

All can be setup in the following steps:

1. Use brew to install NeoVim onto your system.
2. Clone or fork this repository to make it your own, into your '_~/Users/*yourusername*/.config/_' directory. (Overwrite the 'nvim' directory if it exists already after following step **1**)
3. Install the following software, and configure the following environment variables _exactly_ , to complete the setup.

> **NOTE**: This setup does require some knowledge of bash profiles for correctly setting environment variables
> (_used during open BASh sessions_), _**OR**_ _you could just set them within the global environment table
> on windows_ ~ _NOT AS CLEAN_ .

### Environment variables (_Profile Specific_):

You can have multiple programming languages supported within Neovim. However, in order for these languages to work, there are a few pre-requisites
that need to be in place prior to utilisation. Following is a table of environment variables that must be set to the correct values
(_ paths to particular pieces of software _) in accordance to the intended plugins specifications. The plugins themselves dictate
what versions of these software components are depended on in order to work correctly. So, in case of any updates to these plugin specs,
please read them again in case of any changes being made to these dependencies.

| Variable                        | Description                                               | Why?                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JAVA_HOME`                     | Path to Java installation directory.                      | Java 21 required as 'JAVA_HOME' for nvim-jdtls to function. This variable points to the JDK itself, providing programs the java tools required to function. |
| `DOTNET_ROOT`                   | .NET SDK root directory.                                  | .NET6.0 SDK / Runtime required for the OmniSharp LSP support within NeoVim. The latest that can be used is version 8.\*.\*                                  |
| `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` | Specifies default CMake generator.                        | We need to tell the 'Ninja' generator to create instructions for the 'clangd' LSP. It details how C++ projects are structured.                              |
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`              | Specifies build type for CMake (e.g., Debug/Release).     | Change this between 'Debug' or 'Release' depending on whether or not you want to include debug symbols for debugging using nvim-dap in C++ projects.        |
| `CMAKE_BUILD_GENERATOR`         | Specifies the generator to be used for the build process. | Ninja is one build generator that is compatible with neovim.                                                                                                |

> **NOTE:** **'CMAKE_BUILD_GENERATOR'** should only be specified within any 'CMakeLists.txt' files you have within your C++ projects. In case your using other IDEs like Visual Studio too.

### Global environment variables:

Some environment Variables are required to be exposed to the OS at all times. For example, if you're
using the WezTerm Multiplexer (MUX), it will NOT be able to see the variables you've set within your terminal profile. **It can only view those that are set within the global table, via your system settings.**

| Variable              | Description                                            | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to '.wezterm.lua' config file. (Seperate to PATH) | The 'wezterm' process must be able to access its configuration file before it initializes. Since WezTerm is responsible for launching bash specified in 'config.default_prog' and 'config.launch_menu', the configuration needs to be available globally. Not just within a shell profile like '.bashrc' or '.bash_profile'. If the '$WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE' variable is only set in a shell profile, it won't be recognised when WezTerm starts, as the shell itself hasn't been launched yet. |

> **NOTE:** It's important that these variables are set correctly and in the right way so WezTerm
> can see it's configuration and use any custom preferences you've set within your '.wezterm.lua' config file.

#### _Correctly setting WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE on macOS:_

We must use a '**_LaunchAgent_**' via the '_launchd_' / _ Launch Daemon _ binary.

Within the '_~/Library/LaunchAgent_' directory, create a '_plist_' / property list file.
Name it something meaningful, using reverse DNS notation (e.g.: '_com.user.wezterm.env.plist_'), with the extension '.plist'
and populate it with the following:

| Example                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src=".images/Setting WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE.png" alt="WezTerm Logo" width="780" height="320"> |

This is a property list (_plist_) containing instructions for _launchd_ (**macOS's service manager**). It defines a _LaunchAgent_ that sets a persistent
environment variable for the user's session using the '_launchctl setenv_' command.

> **NOTE**: An agent like this runs when the user logs in, allowing the variable to be globally available to any GUI application launched during the session. So, after setting and saving this '.plist' agent file, you **_MUST APPLY_** it by:
>
> - 1st: Logging out of your system.
> - 2nd: Logging back into your system.
>
> Only then will you see the configuration file be picked up by the Wezterm Terminal Emulator.

### **Binaries to add to "_PATH_":**

Considering the scope of this '_configuration_' project, there is a lot of programs that need to be
exposed to the OS. Either via a bash profile, or the global environment variables table (_accessible via your system settings_).
Plugins will then be able to access and utilise these programs within neovim, allowing them to function as intended. Why do I suggest exposing them via
a profile instead of global table? To keep your global environment variables table tidy, as it should only be used for programs that are required system wide.

### **Luarocks modules / rocks ( _packages/libraries_ ) support:**

Luarocks is a native lua package manager. You can download and use modules to make life a little easier both within a Neovim and/or a Wezterm context.

**_What do I mean by this?_**

I mean that it's possible to use luarock modules within Neovim, and also Wezterm. The way this project is configured means that the surrounding WezTerm Application / process 'looks into' the Neovim configuration files, in order to find how it itself is configured, and to also find dependency utility modules. This was purely by choice to keep everything as tightly bundled together as possible.

So, you can easily navigate to and from the same general directory hierarchy to make changes to both WezTerm and Neovim settings.

However, there are steps to properly configure the 'tree' so that the luarock manager installs modules to the correct location so they can actually be used by these applications.

_**Steps to configure:**_

1. Download the luarocks package via homebrew.
2. Create a directory called 'luarocks' within the '~/.config/' directory.
3. Create a file called 'config.lua' file within that 'luarocks' directory.
4. Type the following snippet into that 'config.lua' file:

| Example                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src=".images/luarocks_config.png" alt="WezTerm Logo" width="850" height="300"> |

> _Note_: This path should be later added to the runtimepath (rtp) for both your Neovim and Wezterm application instances, so both can look into this directory to be able to ' _require_ ' modules installed via luarocks.

5. Point the luarocks package manager to it's intended configuration file, by setting the LUAROCKS_CONFIG environment variable within either your '.bash_profile' or '.bashrc':

| Example                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src=".images/luarocks_env_var.png" alt="WezTerm Logo" width="850" height="75"> |

That's it, you should now be able to require modules both within a Neovim or Wezterm application runtime context.

> _Note_: When using the 'luarocks install' command, you **MUST** use the '--tree' parameter to specify the name of the root you wish to access, in order to install the plugin there. 'system' is the default and is considered '_system-wide_', and is handled by homebrew.
