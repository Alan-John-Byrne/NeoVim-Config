> **NOTE:** This is a custom project/IDE using PowerShell7/WezTerm. A work in progress that's ever changing.
> There's plans to create a compatible setup for Unix environments.

**GOAL:** Put multiple complex tools together to form a powerful and extensive development environment.

> **PAIN POINTS**: A list of mistakes I've made, and how to avoid them:
>
> - <u>_'File is too large to open' (mini.files)_</u>: If the file is currently stored
>   on your OneDrive, please ensure your OneDrive is running and synced so you
>   actually have the file locally on your machine, to open it.
> - <u>_'Snacks terminal not opening in the same directory as the current buffer' (snacks.nvim)_</u>: The terminal
>   provided by the snacks.nvim package (<u>_triggered via the keybind 'CTRL + /'_</u>) will open in the same directory
>   where you initially entered neovim. I've added a which-key keybind to allow you
>   set the current directory to the parent directory of the current buffer, use '\<leader> + \\'. Then when you enter
>   the snacks terminal, it'll open in the same directory as the current buffer, without having to first exit and re-enter
>   neovim in that desired directory.

## Use Cases:

- **Work on Projects (<u>eg: _React + Ts /w Vite_</u>)**:
  ![Vite + React + TS](.images/vite_reactts_project.jpg)

- **Study Algorithms w/ WezTerm Multiplexing (_<u>Image Previewer included</u>_)**:
  ![Studying Kandane's Algorithm](.images/study_algos.jpg)

  > **NOTE:** Image previewing ONLY WORKS in terminals that support the necessary image protocols, such as WezTerm, Kitty, or other compatible terminal emulators. This will **NOT** work in PowerShell, Command Prompt, or basic terminal emulators that lack support for those protocols.

- **Debug Software w/ Nvim-Dap**:

- **Use Polyglot Development w/ WezTerm Multiplexing**:

- _Unit Testing_: (<u>Coming Soon - /w neotest</u>)

## Setup:

All can be setup in the following steps:

1. Use a windows package manager of your choice (_i.e.: <u>winget</u> or <u>chocolatey</u>_) to install NeoVim onto your system.
2. Clone or fork this repository to make it your own, into your '_C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local_' directory. (Overwrite the 'nvim' directory if it exists already after following step **1**)
3. Install the following software, and configure the following environment variables <u>_exactly_</u> as is to complete the setup.

> **NOTE**: This setup does require some knowledge of powershell profiles for correctly setting environment variables
> (_used during open powershell sessions_), or you could just set them within the global table on windows.

### Environment Variables (Profile Specific)

This config demonstrates the possibility of having multiple languages supported within neovim.
In order for these languages to work, there are a few pre-requisites that need to be in place prior to utilisation. Following is a table
of environment variables that must be set to the correct values (_<u>paths to particular pieces of software</u>_) in accordance to the intended plugins
specifications. The plugins themselves dictate what versions of these software components are depended on in order to work correctly.
So, in case of any updates to these plugin specs, please read the plugin specs in case errors pop up, to see if any dependencies listed below have
been changed / updated.

| Variable                             | Description                                               | Why?                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$env:JAVA_HOME`                     | Path to Java installation directory.                      | Java 21 required as 'JAVA_HOME' for nvim-jdtls to function. This variable points to the JDK itself, providing programs the java tools required to function. |
| `$env:DOTNET_ROOT`                   | .NET SDK root directory.                                  | .NET6.0 SDK / Runtime required for the OmniSharp LSP support within NeoVim. The latest that can be used is version 8.\*.\*                                  |
| `$env:CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` | Specifies default CMake generator.                        | We need to tell the 'Ninja' generator to create instructions for the 'clangd' LSP. It details how C++ projects are structured.                              |
| `$env:CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`              | Specifies build type for CMake (e.g., Debug/Release).     | Change this between 'Debug' or 'Release' depending on whether or not you want to include debug symbols for debugging using nvim-dap in C++ projects.        |
| `$env:CMAKE_BUILD_GENERATOR`         | Specifies the generator to be used for the build process. | Ninja is one build generator that is compatible with neovim.                                                                                                |

> **NOTE:** **'CMAKE_BUILD_GENERATOR'** should only be specified within any 'CMakeLists.txt' files you have within your C++ projects. In case your using other IDEs like Visual Studio too.

### Global Environment Variables:

Some environment Variables are required to be exposed to the OS at all times. For example, if you're
using the WezTerm Multiplexer (MUX), it won't be able to see the variables you've set within your terminal
profiles, <u>**only those that are set within the global table, via your system settings**</u>.

| Variable               | Description                                             | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to '.wezterm.lua' config file. (Seperate to $PATH) | The 'wezterm.exe' process must be able to access its configuration file before it initializes. Since WezTerm is responsible for launching the shell or terminal program specified in 'config.default_prog' and 'config.launch_menu', the configuration needs to be available globally. Not just within a shell profile like '.bashrc' or 'profile.ps1'. If the '$WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE' variable is only set in a shell profile, it won't be recognised when WezTerm starts, as the shell itself hasn't been launched yet. |
| `path\to\pwsh.exe`     | Path to 'pwsh.exe'. (Included in $PATH)                 | Required for WezTerm terminal emulator to properly execute PowerShell 7 commands and scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

> **NOTE:** It's important that these variables are set correctly and in the right way so WezTerm
> can see it's configuration and use any custom preferences you've set within your '.wezterm.lua' config file.

### **Required executables to add to the "$PATH" variable:**

Considering the scope and ambitious versatility of this configuration project, there's a lot of programs that need to be
exposed to the OS via either a powershell profile, or your global environment variables table ( accessible via the windows settings ).
This allows for these programs to be used by the plugins within neovim, allowing them to work as intended. Why do I suggest exposing them via
a profile instead of global table? To keep your global variables tidy. The global table should only be used for essential requirements.
